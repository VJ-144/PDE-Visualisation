PYTHON FILES 

----    The RunCode.py program runs the code. The following parameters must be 
	specified in terminal when running the code in this order.

        'python RunCode.py N x x x'

        Parameters:
            x - 
            x - 
            x - 
            String - 


            The field parameter runs the simulation for either a point charge (electric parameter) or
 	    a charged wire (magnetic parameter).

            example: 'python RunCode.py 50 0.0 jacobi electric'
                      This would run the jacobi simulation of a point charge in a 3D cube
		          until converged.


----    The PlotData.py file uses the stored data files in the pre-simulated data directory /Data/ to 
	plot specified in the questions. The plotting is controlled by a main() function located at the 
	bottom of the file.



----    The Functions.py contains all the functions used in the exam.



COMMENTS ON DATA AND GRAPHS FOR MARKING


----    The plotted graphs for grading can be located within the directory called /Plots/ and the contents are
          indicated by the the filenames
